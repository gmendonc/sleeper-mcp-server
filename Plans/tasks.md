## üìù Notes

**Development Philosophy:** Ship fast, iterate faster. Prioritize working functionality that provides immediate value.

**Testing Approach:** Manual testing via Claude Desktop for now. Automated tests added as features stabilize.

**User Feedback:** Track common queries to identify missing functionality and improve tool descriptions.

**API Considerations:** Respect Sleeper API rate limits (1000 req/min). Current caching strategy handles this well.
